Smoothie Shop

This project will allow customers to order smoothies from a menu or select ingredients on a per cost basis and have them made into a smoothie. It will then
bill the customer and take away from their wallet funds, if no wallet funds then it will say come back later. 

This works by having files read into the program and then displays the smoothies/fruits from those files into the menu, which will be displayed to the user through
terminal / GUI.
